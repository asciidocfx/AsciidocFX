After all of the RCs, It's time to express all the noteworthy features. To examine all the details, please visit https://github.com/asciidocfx/AsciidocFX/compare/v1.3.6...v1.3.8[Full Changelog]

==== Features

* Making a presentation in AsciidocFX is not a dream anymore! Thanks to https://github.com/rahmanusta[Rahman Usta], AsciidocFX now allows you to make slides by means of https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/[Reveal.js] and https://github.com/imakewebthings/deck.js[Deck.js] backends. To make this possible, just right-click anywhere on the workdir panel and then follow the path `new/slide`.
* As of 1.3.8, AFX also provides a new backend service called Odt. Using the service, you can convert an asciidoc/markdown document into a file ending with `odt` which stands for word processing (text) documents.
* Another facility comes into play in this release which is _Outline_ View! The Outline view displays an outline of a structured asciidoc/markdown file that is currently open in the editor area. You can jump to an intended section easily.
* You can manipulate the default properties of AFX in the settings panel. To reach that panel, click 3dots(...) / Settings *or* kbd:[Ctrl+F4] . You will see a few sections such as the settings of preview panel and the locations part which lets you override/edit the default css values as well as set the mathjs and kindlegen path.
* By default, auto-saving feature is enable so that when you switch to other applications or when AFX is idle, your documents will be saved by AFX. To disable it, go to the general Settings panel.
* Since AFX supports 5 different services, logging is a must for those who want to know whether a problem occurs or not during every process. To this end, a log view is now available at the bottom of the editor. You are given a few options based on the log view like classifying the log messages according to the log levels and browsing the corresponding log directory.
* AsciidocFX Users can now edit all file formats such as JSON, XML, HTML and so on in the editor.
* Since AFX lets you edit HTML documents, you can likewise preview the content on the HTML preview section.
* You can save the frequently used directories (i.e. your favorite directories) by right-clicking a folder in the Workdir (i.e. treeview ) panel.
* Viewing rendered documents simultaneously in the preview section is now up to you. You can toggle this option from the preview. Just right click somewhere on the preview section and check "Stop Rendering" (https://github.com/asciidocfx/AsciidocFX/issues/95[#95])
* AFX has a Turkish README file.

* AFX has https://github.com/asciidocfx/AsciidocFX/wiki/Chart-Extension#using-external-csv-data[block macros] to reference data in external CSV file so that, users can directly refer to it without giving data inside block.
* As of 1.3.6, AFX does not prompt a warning dialog for empty "new *" tabs on exit.

* A shortcut to (convert and paste) copied selection (i.e. kbd:[Ctrl+V]).
